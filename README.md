Easy to use PC 2K presentation manager using FreeSimpleGUI (was PySimpleGUI). Allows for "packs" of mods to be loaded and switched with each other, and updated automatically in a chosen 2k directory.




## Features

- Support for a combination of Reshade files and standard mods in one pack
- Overwriting if two different packs share mod file names
- New packs can be added or removed from manager
- Packs save between sessions


## Packs

To make a pack:

-   make a folder containing all mods used in the pack, alongside any Reshade .ini file (the manager will place them in the correct 2K directories when loaded)
## Prerequisites

- PC copy of an NBA2K game.
- If not on 2K25 or newer, a [2K Hook](https://www.2kspecialist.net/2023/11/nba-2k24-hook-mods-folder-v2400.html) installation (make sure to put "mods" in lowercase.)
- An installation of [Reshade](https://reshade.me/) in your 2K directory.
